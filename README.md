# SASS Front End Framework
 * Create a Bootstrap-like toolkit in SASS that covers some basic HTML element use cases like headers h1, forms
input, etc. Use the powerful features of SASS, like dividing elements into partials and variable names, to make your life and the end users' life easier.
    
    * Focus on the easy things first - picking a font, buttons, good looking forms, good looking dropdown menus. Then see what you have time left to tackle
    
    * The final product should be a portfolio piece - an embeddable piece of SASS that comes with all the necessary elements to build a website, styled in a theme of your design
    
    * Don't crib existing code - write your own CSS code. Try and only lookup attributes you may be confused about rather than copying boilerplate code for different elements wholesale
    
    * At bare minimum, an HTML page should exist with all of the different elements you've designed, a showcase of these elements and what classes to call to use them
